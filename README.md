# README Generator

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app.
* When a user is prompted for information about the application, the command-line application  dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using node.js inquierer;
leaving the creator to devote more time to working on the project.

* When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
